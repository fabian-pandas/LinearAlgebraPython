# Linear Algebra in Python

Inspired by the _Python For Data Science Cheat Sheet - SciPy Linear Algebra_ this tutorial was made to give an overview
about the topic. 

The overview is located in **.\lintut\tutorial_jupyter.jpynb**

Plain code is located in  **.\lintut\tutorial.py**

## SciPy
The SciPy library is one of the core packages for scientific computing that provides mathematical algorithms and 
convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python.

## NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
