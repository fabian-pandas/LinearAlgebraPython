# Linear Algebra in Python
## Basics with scipy

Based on the _Python For Data Science Cheat Sheet - SciPy Linear Algebra_ this tutorial was made to visualize the
code used there.
The SciPy library is one of the core packages for scientific computing that provides mathematical algorithms and 
convenience functions built on the NumPy extension of Python.
